<h1>HTML: How-To Website!</h1>
<h3>-The Website To Help You Learn HTML!-</h3>
<p>I've had a recent, rapidly-growing love of the internet, along with the amazingness of how, literally me just writing the words on your screen now, can be seen by millions, all around the world! While I know, this will probably never be seen by more than two people, I still think it is a neat idea! <br> So, I thought that it would be fun to make a website to help others see the exitement that I do in HTML!</p>

<p>I love the late 1990's style look to un-edited HTML text, so, I guess we can start there. But wait, there's something else we need to do first... If you think about it, if I just said "¡Hola! ¡Mi llamo es Gabriel, y soy de Estados Unidos!" In the middle of my English senctance, you would be confused, right? Well, that was Spanish, and now that you know that, you know what to look for. Same for the computer. If we just told it to put an HTML sentance in an empty Notepad file, it wouldn't know what to do! So, you have to specifically tell it that you are running HTML.<br></p>

<p><br>So, to start an HTML code, you have to type "< html >". But you can't have just that, you also have to have a "< /html >" following it. The / tells it that is the end of that line. So, all together, you would put "< html > < /html >". So now, you want to make a paragraph, right? Well, for that, you would type "< p > Example Words < /p >". Of course, the "Example Words" would be replaced with whatever you want it to say. Keep in mind, it is required also that the file ending (".rtf", for example) be changed to .html. Otherwise, you would just have the code you wrote all over your screen instead of "Example Words". You also have to have "< body > < /body >" in between the "< html > < /html >" tags, but outside whatever you have as your actual code. Remember that there isn't a space between the "< >" and the tag's word, I had to do that so that it would show the tag instead of run it in the code.</p>
